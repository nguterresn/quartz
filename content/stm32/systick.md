### SysTick as an exception

The SysTick, or SYSTICK, is a built-in 24-bit count down system timer presented in every Cortex-M microcontroller. As a consequence, it is also available in every STM32 microcontroller with the same architecture.

The SysTick also acts as an exception, in parallel with, for example, an _Interrupt Request_ (IRQ). The exception, when _triggered_, is then managed by the _Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller_ (NVIC) and dispatched according to its priority.

This system timer happens to be extremely important due to its goal â€” to be used by an RTOS or as a portable basic timer. According to the datasheet of the STM32F030R8:

> The SysTick calibration value is set to 6000, which gives a reference time base of 1 ms with
the SysTick clock set to 6 MHz (max fHCLK / 8).

A reference time of 1ms is a perfect match for RTOS context switching!

> [!note]
> The calibration value differs between different Cortex-M, and so does fHCLK.

By default, the STM32F030R8 has its HCLK or HSI (High Speed Internal) clock, set as 8MHz.

Reading from the left to the right, the HSI is then divided by 8 to output the Cortex system timer, the SysTick. This flow results in a timer of 1KHz, or 1ms, as presented above.
However, the frequency at which the SysTick runs, can change by:

- Selecting (SW) the PLLCLK or HSE.
- Setting a different HPRE (a prescaler) for SYSCLK.
