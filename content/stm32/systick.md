### SysTick as an exception

The SysTick, or SYSTICK, is a built-in 24-bit count down system timer presented in every Cortex-M microcontroller. As a consequence, it is also available in every STM32 microcontroller with the same architecture.

The SysTick also acts as an exception, in parallel with, for example, an _Interrupt Request_ (IRQ). The exception, when _triggered_, is then managed by the _Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller_ (NVIC) and dispatched according to its priority.

### The importance of SysTick calibration

This system timer happens to be extremely important due to its goal â€” to be used by an RTOS or as a portable basic timer. According to the datasheet of the STM32F030R8:

> The SysTick calibration value is set to 6000, which gives a reference time base of 1 ms with
the SysTick clock set to 6 MHz (max fHCLK / 8).

A reference time of 1ms is a perfect match for RTOS context switching!

> [!note]
> The calibration value differs between different Cortex-M, and so does fHCLK.

By default, the STM32F030R8 has its HCLK or [HSI](https://www.embeddedhow.com/post/understanding-clock-source-in-arm-cortex-m) (High Speed Internal) clock, set as 8MHz.

Reading from the left to the right, the HSI is then divided by 8 to output the Cortex system timer, the SysTick. This flow results in a timer of 1MHz, or 1us.
However, the frequency at which the SysTick runs, can change by:

- Selecting (SW) the PLLCLK or HSE.
- Setting a different HPRE (a prescaler) for SYSCLK.

In a case where SYSCLK is 64MHz, the frequency of the SysTick clock is 8MHz (assuming the prescaler doesn't change).

### HAL_InitTick

Let's take a first look at a simple HAL implementation and its use of SysTick.

The function `HAL_Init` is the first function to run to initialize the ST HAL. Interesting enough, even before the peripherals are initialized, the SysTick is set:

```c
HAL_StatusTypeDef HAL_Init(void)
{
  /* Use systick as time base source and configure 1ms tick (default clock after Reset is HSI) */

  HAL_InitTick(TICK_INT_PRIORITY);

  /* Init the low level hardware */
  HAL_MspInit();

  /* Return function status */
  return HAL_OK;
}
```

Let's then take a deeper look inside `HAL_InitTick`:

```c
__weak HAL_StatusTypeDef HAL_InitTick(uint32_t TickPriority)
{
  /*Configure the SysTick to have interrupt in 1ms time basis*/
  if (HAL_SYSTICK_Config(SystemCoreClock / (1000U / uwTickFreq)) > 0U)
  {
    return HAL_ERROR;
  }

  /* Configure the SysTick IRQ priority */
  if (TickPriority < (1UL << __NVIC_PRIO_BITS))
  {
    HAL_NVIC_SetPriority(SysTick_IRQn, TickPriority, 0U);
    uwTickPrio = TickPriority;
  }
  else
  {
    return HAL_ERROR;
  }

   /* Return function status */
  return HAL_OK;
}
```

The HAL introduces a bit of bloated code, but essentially, the `HAL_InitTick` sets the number of ticks necessary to result in a 1ms SysTick interrupt. Inside `HAL_SYSTICK_Config` the priority of the _SysTick_IRQn_, the SysTick _Interrupt Request_, is set to the lowest priority possible (in the case of STM32F030R8 is 3, where 0 is the highest priority).

```c
__STATIC_INLINE uint32_t SysTick_Config(uint32_t ticks)
{
  SysTick->LOAD  = (uint32_t)(ticks - 1UL);                         /* set reload register */
  NVIC_SetPriority (SysTick_IRQn, (1UL << __NVIC_PRIO_BITS) - 1UL);

  (...)
}
```

However, the priority is then changed from lowest to highest priority in the next step of `HAL_Init`, since _TickPriority_ is 0:

```c
if (TickPriority < (1UL << __NVIC_PRIO_BITS))
{
  HAL_NVIC_SetPriority(SysTick_IRQn, TickPriority, 0U);
  uwTickPrio = TickPriority;
}
```

This is quite important! This change of priority means that the SysTick will suspend any Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) from running as long as SysTick is being executed.

> [!note]
> The frequency of the system clock might change after the SysTick is first set. For example, the HAL of STM32F030R8 sets first the SysTick at a frequency of 8MHz and follows by changing it to 48MHz later. The priority remains.

Finally, anytime SysTick is triggered, `SysTick_Handler` is called:

```c
void SysTick_Handler(void)
{
  HAL_IncTick();
}
```

And `HAL_IncTick` increments a milisecond:

```c
__weak void HAL_IncTick(void)
{
  uwTick += uwTickFreq;
}
```

### Priorities

The priority of the SysTick IRQ is key here. The ST HAL uses the SysTick for its own delays and timeouts, hence the importance of a correctly set prio.

```c
#define  TICK_INT_PRIORITY            ((uint32_t)0)    /*!< tick interrupt priority (lowest by default)  */
/*  Warning: Must be set to higher priority for HAL_Delay()  */
/*  and HAL_GetTick() usage under interrupt context          */
```

The languague is odd, but the `TICK_INT_PRIORITY` is actually set to the highest priority (numerically the lowest). Having a high priority for the SysTick is effective for maintaining precise time tracking, but it can result in frequent interruptions of lower-priority tasks.

### Priorities with freeRTOS

The popular freeRTOS uses SysTick as its tick interrupt and it is [recommended](https://forums.freertos.org/t/systick-priority-vs-all-cortex-m-priorities/9289/2) to keep the priority low.
This might result in some timing jitter but will ensure the remaining tasks work as expected.

Other very important aspect of the Cortex-M interrupts priorities is how they always need to be explicitly defined when [using freeRTOS API functions](https://www.freertos.org/Documentation/02-Kernel/03-Supported-devices/04-Demos/ARM-Cortex/RTOS-Cortex-M3-M4#relevance-when-using-the-rtos-2):

> Cortex-M interrupts default to having a priority value of zero. Zero is the highest possible priority value. Therefore, never leave the priority of an interrupt that uses the interrupt safe RTOS API at its default value.
