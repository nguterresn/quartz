### About me

Embedded Software Developer focused on making things. I've acquired experience with
microcontrollers, Linux and real time operating systems with a strong link
between the device and the cloud. Mostly focused on C/C++, CMake and
Javascript. I successfully build, test and maintain code for systems on the
field. My hobbyist side also works with PCB & CAD Design.
